# SWITCHES
SWITCHES is a Parallel Runtime system for Task-based Data-flow Execution. It is implemented for multi- and many-core processors that support a global address space (shared memory) and uses OpenMP v4.5 compiler directives for writting parallel applications. It consists a preprocessing tool (called Translator) that translates C/C++ code embedded with OpenMP directives to C/C++ pthread-based code...
