SWITCHES is a Parallel Programming Platform (Runtime System, Scheduler, Translator) for Task-based Data-flow Execution. It is implemented for multi- and many-core processors that support a global address space (shared memory) and uses OpenMP v4.5 compiler directives for programming parallel applications.
